export const NO_METHOD = factory<'method.name'>`
No method called \`${'method.name'}\`. The tests won't pass without it.
`('javascript.general.no_method', CommentType.Essential)

export const NO_NAMED_EXPORT = factory<'export.name'>`
No [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
called \`${'export.name'}\`. The tests won't pass without it.

Make sure \`${'export.name'}\` exists and add \`export\` in front of it:

\`\`\`javascript
export \`${'export.name'}\`
\`\`\`
`('javascript.general.no_named_export', CommentType.Essential)

export const NO_DEFAULT_EXPORT = factory`
No [default](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/default)
[export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export).
The tests won't pass without it.

Did you forget adding: \`export default ...\`?
`('javascript.general.no_default_export', CommentType.Essential)

export const NO_PARAMETER = factory<'function.name'>`
Your function \`${'function.name'}\` does not have a parameter.
The tests won't pass without it.
`('javascript.general.no_parameter', CommentType.Essential)

export const UNEXPECTED_PARAMETER = factory<'type'>`
Did not find a parameter of type \`${'type'}\`.
`('javascript.general.unexpected_parameter', CommentType.Actionable)

export const UNEXPECTED_SPLAT_ARGS = factory<
  'splat-arg.name' | 'parameter.type'
>`
Instead of using \`...${'splat-arg.name'}: ${'parameter.type'}[]\`, you should
define a parameter called \`${'splat-arg.name'}\` with the type \`${'parameter.type'}\`.

[Rest parameters / splat arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
are great if you don't know how many values you will receive and it can be an
arbitrary number, but in this case you know how many values you want.
`('javascript.general.unexpected_splat_args', CommentType.Actionable)

export const PREFER_TEMPLATED_STRINGS = factory`
You're manually building a string using string concatenation. You can use a
[templated string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
instead and interpolate dynamic values:

\`\`\`javascript
"Hello there \${firstName}, I will give you \${calculateInventory()} apples."
\`\`\`

`('javascript.general.prefer_templated_strings', CommentType.Actionable)

export const PREFER_STRICT_EQUALITY = factory`
In _JavaScript_, always prefer [strict (identity and non-identity) equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Identity)
such as \`===\` and \`!==\` over the forms that use implicit type coercion,
such as [\`==\`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality)
and [\`!=\`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Inequality),
unless you explicitly want to coerce the type of one of the two operands.

There are definitely cases where you'll want to use non-strict equality, but
that's not the case in this exercise.
`('javascript.general.prefer_strict_equality', CommentType.Actionable)

export const PREFER_UNPREFIXED_UNDERSCORE_PARAMETERS =
  factory<'parameter.name'>`
Unlike other languages, \`_parameter\` does not signify a *private* variable.

Instead, in Javascript, prefixing a parameter with an underscore will stop
most IDEs from highlighting that parameter if it's unused, which is actually a
tool you probably want to keep in this case. Remove the underscore \`_\` from
${'parameter.name'} in order to fix this.
`(
    'javascript.general.prefer_unprefixed_underscore_parameters',
    CommentType.Informative
  )

export const PARSE_ERROR = factory<'error' | 'details'>`
There is something wrong with your submission, most likely a Syntax Error:

Message: "${'error'}"

\`\`\`
${'details'}
\`\`\`
`('javascript.general.parse_error', CommentType.Essential)

export const PREFER_CONST_OVER_LET_AND_VAR = factory<'kind' | 'name'>`
Instead of \`${'kind'} ${'name'}\`, consider using \`const\`.

\`const\` is a signal that the identifier won't be reassigned, which SHOULD be
true for this top-level constant. (Not to be confused with _immutable values_).
`('javascript.general.prefer_const_over_let_and_var', CommentType.Informative)

export const BETA_COMMENTARY_PREFIX = factory`
ðŸ§ª This solution's output contains a new format of comments that is currently
in Beta. Instead of providing copyable commentary, this analyzer will give
helpful content for mentoring this soluton.

- \`ðŸ’¬\` indicates **copyable content**. This can be changed to match your
tone but the overal message matches the mentoring guidelines for this track.
- \`âš¡\` indicates **danger**. The analyzer could not do its job properly. You
MUST double check if it did not make a mistake. If it DID make a mistake,
please open an issue [here](https://github.com/exercism/javascript-analyzer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Abug%3A+bug&template=incorrect-analysis.md&title=Incorrect+Analysis%3A+) so the analyzer can be updated.
- \`ðŸ“•\` indicates **information for _you_**, the mentor. You SHOULD NOT relay
this to the student directly. Use it to determine what you want to say.
- If there is no icon, the commentary has not been updated to the latest
standard. Proceed with caution.
`(
  'javascript.general.beta_disapprove_commentary_prefix',
  CommentType.Informative
)

export const ERROR_CAPTURED_NO_SOURCE = factory<'expected' | 'available'>`
Expected source file "${'expected'}", found: ${'available'}.
`('javascript.general.error_captured_no_source', CommentType.Essential)

export const EXEMPLAR_SOLUTION = factory`
ðŸŽ‰ That is an exemplar solution. Congratulations. It is exactly what we think
is the most idiomatic implementation of the tasks at hand. Rejoice!
`('javascript.general.exemplar', CommentType.Celebratory)

export const FUNCTION_NOT_OPTIMAL = factory<'function'>`
ðŸ“• It looks like ${'function'} is not optimal. This analyzer is a Work In
Progress and can't tell you exactly why it thinks something is not optimal. Feel
free to ignore this feedback. If you wish to attempt to resolve it, the advice
is as follows: this function is expected to be as simple as possible, without
declaring any extra variables.`(
  'javascript.general.function_not_optimal',
  CommentType.Informative
)

export const SIGNATURE_CHANGED = factory`
ðŸ“• Don't change the function declarations unless absolutely necessary. The stub
provides the correct exports and correct function declarations, with the
expected amount and format of parameters. It is sometimes possible to change the
function signature (change how its parameters work), but in this case the
parameters were already optimally defined.
`('javascript.general.signature_changed', CommentType.Informative)

export const REPLACE_MAGIC_WITH_IDENTIFIER = factory<'literal' | 'identifier'>`
The a magic value \`${'literal'}\` can be replaced by \`${'identifier'}\`. When
possible, named constants are often a better choice than in-lined literals.
`('javascript.general.replace_magic_with_identifier', CommentType.Actionable)
