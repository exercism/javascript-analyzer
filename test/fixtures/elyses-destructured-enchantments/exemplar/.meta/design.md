# Design

## Learning objectives

- Using destructuring to get the first item of an array
- Using destructuring to get the second item of an array (skip hole)
- Using destructuring + rest elements to get the last item of an array
- Using destructuring to get the first two items of an array
- Using destructuring + rest elements to get the head and tail of an array
- Using spread to turn an array into a list of parameters
- Using rest elements to turn a list of parameters into an array
- Using destructuring to swap two values

## Out of scope

- Anything with objects
- Default values

## Concepts

- `array-destructuring`
- `rest-and-spread`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays` are needed to understand array restructuring
- `functions` are needed as basis for rest parameters
- `objects` are needed for object spread etc. (will be added to the exercise/concept later)
