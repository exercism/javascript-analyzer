# Design

## Learning objectives

- How to use a `for...of` loop
- How to use `forEach`
- Drawbacks of `forEach`

## Out of Scope

The following topics are out of scope because they will be covered by other concept exercise.

- Methods for array transformation or other analysis then just going through the array
- Sets
- [Iterators][mdn-iterators] in general

## Concepts

The Concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `array-loops`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays` because they are the basis data type here
- `for-loops` because they teach the basics of iteration
- `callbacks` and `arrow-functions` because they are needed for `forEach`
- `conditionals` because they are needed in the exercise

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer][analyzer]:

The analyzer should check that the way to iterate that is mentioned in the instructions was actually used (`essential` feedback).
