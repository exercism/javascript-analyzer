# Design

## Learning objectives

- How to define a function
- What happens if there is no return statement
- Return an object if you want to return multiple values
- All parameters are optional in JS
- What happens if the function is called with a different number of parameters than mentioned in the function definition
- How to set default parameters
- Pass by value vs. pass by reference
- What are function expressions
- Function scope (about.md)

## Out of Scope

The following topics will be introduced later and should therefore not be part of this concept exercise.

- Rest parameters
- Callbacks
- Methods
- Arrow functions (will be introduced later together with callbacks)
- Recursion
- Closures
- Higher Order Functions
- Generators

## Concepts

The Concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `functions`

## Prerequisites

- `null-undefined` because they are needed for return values, default params etc.
- `objects` are needed in the exercise
- `arrays` are needed in the exercise

## Notes

The story was inspired by the [Lasagna Master Exercise in the Swift track][swift-lasagna-master].
Most tasks needed to be replaced though to achieve an exercise that fits the JavaScript learning objectives.
